# Progress

**Current milestone:** M00 — evidence baseline and gate experiments
**Owner decision pending:** G02 D1, deferred by the owner until round 4 and the Windows/WSL tests (see below).

## Owner decisions and inputs (2026-10-06)

- **G02:**
  - D1 language: deferred until more research and experiments (round 4) and
    G03 Windows/WSL testing.
  - D2: the owner's personal ergonomics are not a factor; the row becomes
    agentic and open-source maintainability.
  - D3: the orchestrator's rulings stand.
- **G04:** D1–D5 are all yes (new grants under lock; memory-only working key;
  signed macOS bundle; P5 may create and delete a CTK identity in the real
  token store; encrypted offline K_ca backup). Q4 was delegated, and the
  decision is recorded in g04 §9.1.
- **G03:**
  - E-2: default non-exposure is accepted.
  - E-3: the clients are Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Cursor and OpenCode. The
    upstream set is re-asked.
  - E-4: delegated; no packaged client (keep it simple).
  - E-5: delegated; accept and disclose. Recorded in g03 §6.1.
- **Primitives Q1:** accept and disclose (option a).
- **Windows host:** the owner's Windows 11 PC with WSL2 Ubuntu
  (amangamingpc-Ubuntu, 100.66.192.34, reached over the tailnet) is
  available for G03/G02 testing. A dedicated, revocable test key is waiting
  for the owner to install it (the orchestrator does not extract the owner's
  Termius credentials).
- **Cleanup:** `d.env`, `p.env` and the Heimdall `/tmp` residue (1209
  entries) were deleted on 2026-10-06 with owner approval.
- **Still open from the owner:**
  - macOS lock/logout/reboot probes;
  - the SSH pain-point list;
  - E6 (Win32-OpenSSH Preview baseline);
  - E8 (doc snapshots);
  - whether a record that ran everywhere except Windows is `verified` or
    `blocked`;
  - whether synthetic canary-format strings in test inputs break the canary
    rule;
  - the E-3 upstream set.

## Decisions recorded by the orchestrator

- 2026-10-03: G02 contract clarifications K1–K12 (`docs/g02/slice-contract.md` §9).
- 2026-10-03: gate-probe status convention (`tests/evidence/README.md`).

## Blockers

- Windows 11 / WSL2 host: available (owner PC). Access is waiting on the owner installing the dedicated test key. Probes that need a second Windows account or admin rights are still blocked until authorized.
- Owner-driven macOS screen lock, logout and reboot cycles block the G04 lock probes.
- An owner pain-point list blocks the ADR-0001 baseline-friction worksheet.

## Resume notes

- Workflow results are in `tests/evidence/artifacts/m00-wf{1,...,6}/`. `m00-wf6/` holds round 3c.
- G02 prototype rounds are closed (contract §9.5, 6de1d95).
- Final commits:
  - harness 2.4.2: c07f702
  - TS verdict: 767aeac
  - Go: 38b6b72, 139/139 darwin+linux
  - Rust: d8f0cbe, 139/139 darwin+linux
  - measurements: 97417f7
- ADR-0002 revised after review-2 (a8cf583) and parity probes (§6.1). It is ready for the owner.
- `d.env` / `p.env` in the repo root (2026-10-03 16:50, keys PATH and HOME only) are stray env dumps from an earlier session. They are not committed. Delete them at cleanup with the /tmp residue: `/tmp/hpa*` (~930 dirs), `/tmp/M00-T05-*`, `/tmp/r4fix`, `/tmp/hp-*`, `/tmp/bun-src`, `/tmp/ts-research`.

## Next actions

1. Present the decision package (D1, D2, D3 rulings) together with the other batched owner questions. Do not start M01 before the owner records D1.
