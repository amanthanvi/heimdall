# Progress

**Current milestone:** M00 — evidence baseline and gate experiments
**Owner decision pending:** none yet. The G02 language decision and the batched questions come at the end of M00.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M00-T01 current-state note | verified | `docs/current-state.md` |
| M00-T02 source pins + support matrix | implemented_unverified | Committed in d096a64. Reproducible pins; review findings fixed but the fixes have not been re-reviewed. Owner items E6 and E8 |
| M00-T03 disposable SSH fixtures | verified | Committed in 2272e74. Rows 1–5 verified; native-platform rows blocked |
| M00-T04 G03 Windows/WSL | implemented_unverified | Committed in 8418dc9. Two review rounds resolved. Every native record is blocked (no Windows 11/WSL2 host) |
| M00-T04 G04 managed credentials | implemented_unverified | Committed in b44c312. Experiments verified (mechanism level). Recipe B1 pending. Lock probes blocked on owner |
| M00-T05 G02 language/TUI + ADR | blocked | Decision package complete: ADR-0002 proposed, re-reviewed, parity-probed. Blocked on owner decision D1 (with D2–D4) |
| M00-T06 release contract etc. | implemented_unverified | Committed in 18bb8df |

## Decisions recorded by the orchestrator

- 2026-10-03: G02 contract clarifications K1–K12 (`docs/g02/slice-contract.md` §9).
- 2026-10-03: gate-probe status convention (`tests/evidence/README.md`).

## Blockers

- No native Windows 11 / WSL2 host. This blocks every G03 native probe and Windows artifact execution.
- Owner-driven macOS screen lock, logout and reboot cycles block the G04 lock probes.
- An owner pain-point list blocks the ADR-0001 baseline-friction worksheet.

## Resume notes

- Workflow results are in `tests/evidence/artifacts/m00-wf{1,...,6}/`. `m00-wf6/` holds round 3c.
- G02 prototype rounds are closed (contract §9.5, 6de1d95).
- Final commits:
  - harness 2.4.2: c07f702
  - TS verdict: 767aeac
  - Go: 38b6b72, 139/139 darwin+linux
  - Rust: d8f0cbe, 139/139 darwin+linux
  - measurements: 97417f7
- ADR-0002 revised after review-2 (a8cf583) and parity probes (§6.1). It is ready for the owner.
- `d.env` / `p.env` in the repo root (2026-10-03 16:50, keys PATH and HOME only) are stray env dumps from an earlier session. They are not committed. Delete them at cleanup with the /tmp residue: `/tmp/hpa*` (~930 dirs), `/tmp/M00-T05-*`, `/tmp/r4fix`, `/tmp/hp-*`, `/tmp/bun-src`, `/tmp/ts-research`.

## Next actions

1. Present the decision package (D1, D2, D3 rulings) together with the other batched owner questions. Do not start M01 before the owner records D1.
